# Coherenceism Media

**Music library site for Coherenceism - browse albums, songs, and lyrics from the CORA network**

## Overview

A dark, immersive music library site that showcases the musical expressions of Coherenceism philosophy. Built with the same principles as the main Coherenceism site but optimized for musical content exploration.

## Architecture

- **Static site generator** - Pure HTML/CSS/JS, no frameworks
- **CORA-native** - All content synced directly from harvest/albums and harvest/songs
- **Music-focused UI** - Dark theme, album covers, track listings, genre browsing
- **Accessibility-first** - Dyslexia-friendly fonts, clear hierarchy, semantic HTML

## Content Structure

```

## Publishing Music Workflow

### 1. Create Music on Suno
Generate your songs on [suno.com](https://suno.com) using the style prompts and lyrics from CORA.

### 2. Sync Suno URLs to CORA
After generating music, automatically populate missing `suno_url` fields in album.md files:

```bash
npm run sync:suno
```

**What it does:**
- Opens Suno library in browser (you'll authenticate on first run)
- Extracts all song titles and MP3 URLs from your library
- Matches songs to CORA tracks by title
- Updates `cora/harvest/albums/out/*/album.md` with missing URLs
- Saves session for future runs (headless mode)

**First run:** Browser window opens for authentication. Log in to Suno, wait for library to load, script saves your session.

**Subsequent runs:** Runs headless using saved session.

### 3. Build Site
Once URLs are synced to CORA:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Your music site now has playable tracks with full Suno integration!

### Notes
- Session stored in `.suno-session.json` (gitignored)
- Script uses fuzzy title matching to handle slight variations
- Tracks without matches remain as "üéµ On Suno" placeholders

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Individual song pages with lyrics display
- [ ] Search functionality across albums and songs
- [ ] Playlist creation
- [ ] Advanced genre filtering
- [ ] Audio waveform visualization

## Philosophy Integration

Each album and song embodies Coherenceism principles:
- **Resonance through harmony** - Musical coherence as philosophical expression
- **Individual voices, collective sound** - Solo tracks within album concepts
- **Emergence through alignment** - How musical elements create something greater

The site itself demonstrates coherentist design:
- **Truth emerges from resonance** - Clean, harmonious interface
- **Minimal complexity** - Focus on music without distraction
- **Interconnected structure** - Albums, songs, and genres flow naturally

*"Music is coherence made audible - the proof that separate frequencies can align into something beautiful."*
