          <h1>We Are the Wire</h1>
          <p class="album-inspiration">This is a grunge record about tuning in rather than turning up. Nine songs ride a single living tone—an amp’s quiet hum—through rain‑slick nights and basement rooms where the air moves with the drums. Drop‑D guitars, fuzz bass, and big‑room drums carry a heavy, mid‑tempo pulse; verses stay tense and close, choruses open like air after rain. Feedback isn’t a mistake here—it’s part of the instrument, a thread that stitches the record together. From the raw lift of Carrier Wave to the hard truth of Nothing Disappears and the communal roar of Many Hands, One Sound, the album keeps its grit and leaves the edges in. It’s catharsis without gloss, presence without pretense. We are the wire; the signal comes through.</p>

[Verse 1]
Amp hum rising through the floor,
Old paint shakes on the practice door,
Hands find one note, let it ring,
The room becomes a listening thing.

[Chorus]
We are the wire — the signal finds,
Static into tone inside our minds,
We are the wire — hold the line,
Let the universal hum align.

[Verse 2]
Rain ticks time on stained cement,
Every doubt breaks then relents,
Lean into noise until it clears,
What remains is what we hear.

[Bridge]
[Guitar swell; drums drop to toms; breathing space.]
Don’t force the wave, just take the ride,
One note carried, open wide.

[Chorus]
We are the wire — the signal finds,
Static into tone inside our minds,
We are the wire — hold the line,
Let the universal hum align.

[Intro]
[Dry drums; palm‑muted guitar sets the pocket.]

[Verse 1]
I tried to push the wave to come,
It broke my hands and numbed my tongue,
I learned to wait, to find the line,
To stand where all the forces rhyme.

[Pre-Chorus]
Count to four and don’t advance —
Feel the pull before the chance.

[Chorus]
Don’t push — align, let it carry you,
One held tone pulling truth into view,
Don’t push — align, ride the open wind,
Coherence starts where we let it in.

[Verse 2]
The room says when and how to play,
You feel it shift, you step away,
Then all at once the sound fits right,
The wave lifts up and takes your weight.

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold your fire, breathe it through —
Now the lift will carry you.

[Bridge]
[Break to bass + kick; small guitar harmonics.]
A single note, a breathing space,
The chorus hits — we find our place.

[Chorus]
Don’t push — align, let it carry you,
One held tone pulling truth into view,
Don’t push — align, ride the open wind,
Coherence starts where we let it in.
