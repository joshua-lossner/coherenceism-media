          <h1>Roots and Resonance — Coherenceism in Roots Reggae & Dub</h1>
          <p class="album-inspiration">A roots‑forward reggae album that carries Coherenceism’s tone: low, warm bass and an easy one‑drop that leaves space for breath. Upstroke guitar and organ bubble keep the pocket steady while horn lines and a melodica hook thread a simple two‑ or three‑note “resonance motif” across songs. Dub is a technique, not the destination: tasteful spring reverb and tape echo open pockets without drowning the message.</p>

[Verse 1]
Morning light on zinc and stone,
Shop doors lift, the street is home.
Footsteps fall in time so sweet,
Hear the city find its beat.

[Chorus]
One field, one heartbeat,
Many voices, one steady beat.
One field, one heartbeat—
Lift each other on the street.

[Verse 2]
Old man sweeps the front step clean,
Kids play tag between the green.
Vendors call and neighbors greet,
Every smile keeps time in feet.

[Chorus]
One field, one heartbeat,
Many voices, one steady beat.

[Instrumental Break]
[Snare cross‑stick, bass and echo horn tags drift and return]

One field, one heartbeat,
Many voices, one steady beat.
