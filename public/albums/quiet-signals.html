              <h1>Quiet Signals</h1>
              <div class="album-concept"><p>An album for late trains and quiet rooms. It treats breath, touch, and pauses as instruments. Songs move like small decisions: a held beat, a rotated coaster, a single LED blink. Field recordings (train hum, HVAC cycles) and tape‑warm keys sit under hushed vocals. The arc moves from learning to listen (1–3), through pressure and misdirection (4–6), to alignment and a small, decisive move (7–8).</p></div>

Buzz in the lights, a breath I can count
Doors kiss shut, the platform thins out
Lines on a map, dots in a row
Paper remembers the places we go

[Chorus]
I draw the noise to find the line
Hold one beat between the signs
In the pause the city lifts
Quiet hands and tiny shifts

[Verse 2]
Shoes that don’t speak, a fingertip near
Taps the white where nothing appears
Shade the blank ‘til a corridor glows
Ghost‑colored path only silence knows

[Bridge]
[Pencil on card, breath in four]
Wait for the gap, then nothing more

[Verse 2]
Corner you favor lights up
Counts don’t match when you check them up
Mirror the urge and let it fade
Gentle refusal is brave

[Bridge]
[Tap — wait — tap]
Right stake rises in the gap

[Chorus]
Wait for breath, then confirm
Twice around before you turn
Noise will beg you to move fast
Hold your line, let panic pass

[Outro]
[Alarm test chorale; then off]">
