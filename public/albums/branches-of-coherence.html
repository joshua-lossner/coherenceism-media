              <h1>Branches of Coherence — A Smooth Jazz Suite</h1>
              <div class="album-concept"><p>A late‑night, unhurried suite where each piece reflects a branch of Coherenceism. The palette stays warm and breathable—Rhodes and upright bass beneath brushed drums; tenor sax, flugelhorn, and clean guitar share the melody. A three‑note “resonance motif” appears across the album, introduced gently in Track 1, reharmonized mid‑sequence, and resolved in the closer. Tempos stay relaxed (70–95 BPM); the playing favors tone, silence, and conversation over virtuosity. The arc moves from wide‑field awareness toward intimate practice—nothing forced, everything placed.</p></div>

[Low piano rumble; guitar pickup]

[Verse 1]
Old sign faded on the edge of town,
We lost a light but the moon came round,
Pack up the pain, lay it in the ground,
Come springtime up pops a brand new sound.

[Chorus]
Nothing really ends, it just bends into a start,
Turn it like a record till it finds the heart,
Nothing really ends, hear the chorus make amends,
We sing it back together — nothing really ends.

[Verse 2]
Last dance over, but the feet still know,
There’s a road from here where the slow winds blow,
We plant a little melody and let it grow,
A second verse rising where the tears used to go.

[Sax Solo]
[Tenor sings the hook]

Nothing really ends, it just bends into a start,
Turn it like a record till it finds the heart.

[Soft guitar and “oohs”]

[Verse 1]
Coffee cup steam and a window of rain,
Streetlight silver on a quiet lane,
Hands in the still and a name in my chest,
Silence like music when it’s held with the best.

[Chorus]
Quiet attention, hold me true,
I hear the world when I lean to you,
Quiet attention, soft and new,
The room turns gold when I see it through.

[Verse 2]
Breath like a tide and a clock taking rest,
Neon hum low like a hymn in the west,
Nothing to prove and nothing to chase,
Just you and the moment with a little more space.

[Bridge]
[Under‑voice “oohs” echo the three‑note motif]
If I stop the rush and let it be,
All the tiny lights sing back to me.

[Chorus]
Quiet attention, hold me true,
I hear the world when I lean to you.

[Short guitar riff; band hits]

[Verse 1]
Brought a new voice to the old wood stage,
Simple as a smile, sparks on the page,
Doesn’t change the heart, just turns the gauge,
Same sweet song with a wider range.

[Chorus]
New instrument, same old soul,
Play it true and let it roll,
New instrument, hand in hand,
It multiplies the little band.

[Verse 2]
Wire and wood having quiet talks,
Keys say hello with their sunny walks,
Bass keeps time like a trusted clock,
Drums lay a road you can drive in your socks.

[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar trades 4s with tenor sax]

New instrument, same old soul,
Play it true and let it roll.

[Soft guitar arpeggio]

[Verse 1]
Headlights threading through an empty town,
Windows down and the noise turned down,
Questions rise like the stars come round,
I let them float, I don’t force them down.

[Chorus]
Held in wonder, night grown wide,
I don’t need answers to enjoy the ride,
Held in wonder, open sky,
I sing the road while the miles slide by.

[Verse 2]
Radio hush and a steady line,
Breath on the glass draws a simple sign,
I let the world hum and I take my time,
Trusting the tune more than any design.

[Bridge]
[Sax echoes the three‑note motif]
If I hold the note and let it ring,
The truth shows up in the song I sing.

Held in wonder, night grown wide,
I don’t need answers to enjoy the ride.
