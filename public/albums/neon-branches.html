              <h1>Neon Branches</h1>
              <div class="album-concept"><p>Nine songs mirror the Coherenceism branch order, reframed through an 80s‑alternative lens: urban nights, rain on pavement, neon fog on wet glass. Voice is reflective but unsentimental; intimacy over spectacle. A recurring three‑note resonance motif (scale degrees 1–♭3–4, transposed per key) threads the record—introduced as a guitar arpeggio, resurfacing as a bass hook or synth figure, and resolving in a brighter tint on the closer. Mid‑tempo pulse (90–122 BPM); melancholy that moves.</p></div>

[Clean arpeggio with 1–♭3–4 motif]

Glass roofs, sodium rain,
Signals climbing through the stain.
Static hum under the sky,
Someone else’s thought goes by.

[Chorus]
We’re already in it,
Already in tune.
I hear the carrier,
Cutting through the blue.

Pay phones, late trains,
Neon puddles, ghosted names.
Every window holds a line,
Threading into one design.

[Bass and pads hold; guitars swell]
If you soften, you can hear it—
Every small life, near it.

Running straight through.

Old letters in the rain.

Drifts into gray.

Not gone, just rearranged.

Nothing disappears.

Key ring on a thread,
Ghost echoes in the bed.

Names I almost never call.

Turns and hums, still right here.

Make the field stronger,
Cut the blur in two.
Draw the clean lines—
I’ll hold them with you.

Neon tries to sell me more,
I close the tab, lock the door.
One true thing is enough tonight,
A single path, a steady light.

One clear path, one steady view—
I’ll hold the line with you.

[Guitars sharpen; kit stays tight]
I won’t trade signal for a louder sound.
