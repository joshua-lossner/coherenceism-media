              <h1>Warm Signal — Songs for the Living Line</h1>
              <div class="album-concept"><p>Nine songs trace Coherenceism from wide‑field seeing to daily practice: awareness, composted endings, aligned action, and neighborly care. The sonic palette stays human and analog—Wurli, Hammond, clean guitar, and a rhythm section that leaves air. A quiet three‑note resonance motif threads the record: hinted in the opener, harmonized mid‑sequence, and sung back by the choir in the closer.</p></div>

[Organ swell; guitar with light tremolo]

[Verse 1]
Long road breathing in the light,
Fenceposts flicker left and right.
Wind says every line is tied—
I open up and let it ride.

[Pre‑Chorus]
I’ve been holding life too tight,
Let the field make me wide.

[Chorus]
Give me that wide, wide open mind,
Let the whole world fall in time.

[Verse 2]
Gravel song beneath the tires,
Sunlight threads through phone‑line wires.
Every little rusted sign
Points me to the living line.

[Bridge]
[BGVs swell; Hammond lifts]
If it’s love, it won’t be forced,
Lean with wind and ride the course.

[Chorus]
Give me that wide, wide open mind,
Let the whole world fall in time.

[Chorus]
Give me that wide, wide open mind,
Let the whole world fall in time.

[Fingerpicked guitar; porch ambience]

[Verse 1]
Storm came down and cleared the air,
Leaves lay quiet on the stair.
Names we carved are fading too—
Wood remembers more than we do.

[Pre‑Chorus]
Every ending makes a room,
Where tomorrow takes its bloom.

[Chorus]
Nothing’s gone, we’re only passing through,
Fold it back to feed the living truth.

[Verse 2]
Photo edges curl with time,
Laughter left a steady line.
Hands let go and hands renew—
Love keeps learning how to move.

[Bridge]
[BGVs rise; organ warms]
Lay it down and let it be,
All that’s lost becomes the seed.

[Chorus]
Nothing’s gone, we’re only passing through,
Fold it back to feed the living truth.

[Chorus]
Nothing’s gone, we’re only passing through,
Fold it back to feed the living truth.

[Tambourine shake; guitar sets pocket]

[Verse 1]
Kite line humming, find the hold,
Lean into the living fold.
Boat comes round to meet the tide,
Hands know where the weight will ride.

[Pre‑Chorus]
Every time I try to force,
I lose the easy flow of course.

[Chorus]
Don’t push—lean with the line,
Let the current carry time.

[Verse 2]
Wind through wires, a steady tone,
Shoulder sets and isn’t stone.
Turn your effort just a hair,
Feel the whole world do its share.

[Bridge]
[Organ lifts; BGVs answer]
Power isn’t in the strain,
It’s in the way you meet the grain.

Don’t push—lean with the line,
Let the current carry time.

Kettle sings a quiet line,
Window holds the edge of time.

[Rain on pavement; guitar rings]

[Verse 1]
Morning after, streets are clean,
Phone is full of in‑betweens.
Pick a call and make it ring,
Tell the truth, the simple thing.

[Pre‑Chorus]
I don’t need a perfect plan,
Just the next thing I can stand.

[Chorus]
I ain’t got the whole map,
I’ll do the next true thing.

Lift a box and hold the door,
Write it down and say no more.
Take a breath before I sing—
Choose the small, the steady thing.

Truth is marked in acts of style.

[Rain on pavement; guitar rings]

[Verse 1]
Morning after, streets are clean,
Phone is full of in‑betweens.
Pick a call and make it ring,
Tell the truth, the simple thing.

[Pre‑Chorus]
I don’t need a perfect plan,
Just the next thing I can stand.

[Chorus]
I ain’t got the whole map,
I’ll do the next true thing.

[Verse 2]
Lift a box and hold the door,
Write it down and say no more.
Take a breath before I sing—
Choose the small, the steady thing.

[Bridge]
[BGVs nod; organ warms]
Every corner, every mile,
Truth is marked in acts of style.

[Chorus]
I ain’t got the whole map,
I’ll do the next true thing.

[Chorus]
I ain’t got the whole map,
I’ll do the next true thing.

Pass a bowl from hand to hand,
Fix the latch, it’s loose again.

What we keep is what we share,
Little lights in open air.
