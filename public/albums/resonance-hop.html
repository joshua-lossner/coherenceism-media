          <h1>Resonance Hop</h1>
          <p class="album-inspiration">The sound of Coherenceism through a 1950s jukebox: twangy guitars with tape slap, upright bass that pops, a boogie‑woogie piano grinning in the corner, and a tenor sax that steps out front when the room leans in. Each song translates a branch into a dance—alignment becomes pocket, presence becomes a hush‑and‑harmony doo‑wop, and technology shows up as a new instrument that multiplies what you bring to it. The set stays simple and singable: I‑IV‑V and 12‑bar turns, catchy choruses, and a shared three‑note “resonance” motif that sneaks into intros and breaks. It’s youthful, honest, and built for moving together—because coherence feels like the room falling into time.</p>

Streetlight sparkle on the chrome and the clock,
Heart finds the pocket when the kicks hit the rock,
Feet start talkin’ in a language we got,
Everybody hear it when the room says “hop.”

One field, one pocket, one hop — hey!
One field, one pocket, one hop — hey!
We fall in time and the noise drops out,
One field, one pocket, one hop — shout!

Bass slaps steady like a train on the rail,
Guitar says “yeah” with a shiver and a tail,
Piano grins wide with a left‑hand tale,
Sax leans in when the dancers sail.

[Soft guitar and “oohs”]

[Verse 1]
Coffee cup steam and a window of rain,
Streetlight silver on a quiet lane,
Hands in the still and a name in my chest,
Silence like music when it’s held with the best.

[Chorus]
Quiet attention, hold me true,
I hear the world when I lean to you,
Quiet attention, soft and new,
The room turns gold when I see it through.

[Verse 2]
Breath like a tide and a clock taking rest,
Neon hum low like a hymn in the west,
Nothing to prove and nothing to chase,
Just you and the moment with a little more space.

[Bridge]
[Under‑voice “oohs” echo the three‑note motif]
If I stop the rush and let it be,
All the tiny lights sing back to me.

[Chorus]
Quiet attention, hold me true,
I hear the world when I lean to you.

[Claps on two and four; piano lick quotes motif]

[Verse 1]
One stitch, two stitch, keep it tight,
Little wins working through the night,
Patch that tear with a steady light,
Small hands weaving till it feels just right.

[Chorus]
Thread by thread we make it true,
Thread by thread with me and you,
Hold the line and pull it through,
Thread by thread, the pattern grew.

[Verse 2]
Pick it up when a friend falls down,
Share your song, give back the crown,
Tiny notes turn a whole room round,
Find the chord where the hearts get found.

[Instrumental Break]
[Piano answers guitar; trade 4s]

[Chorus]
Thread by thread we make it true,
Thread by thread with me and you.

[Low piano rumble; guitar pickup]

[Verse 1]
Old sign faded on the edge of town,
We lost a light but the moon came round,
Pack up the pain, lay it in the ground,
Come springtime up pops a brand new sound.

[Chorus]
Nothing really ends, it just bends into a start,
Turn it like a record till it finds the heart,
Nothing really ends, hear the chorus make amends,
We sing it back together — nothing really ends.

[Verse 2]
Last dance over, but the feet still know,
There’s a road from here where the slow winds blow,
We plant a little melody and let it grow,
A second verse rising where the tears used to go.

Headlights threading through an empty town,
Windows down and the noise turned down,

I let them float, I don’t force them down.

Held in wonder, night grown wide,
I don’t need answers to enjoy the ride,
Held in wonder, open sky,
I sing the road while the miles slide by.

Radio hush and a steady line,
Breath on the glass draws a simple sign,
I let the world hum and I take my time,
Trusting the tune more than any design.
