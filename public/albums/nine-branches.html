              <h1>Nine Branches</h1>
              <div class="album-concept"><p>Nine songs channel the branches of Coherenceism into a ’90s boom‑bap frame: gritty jazz‑soul chops, punchy drums, and grounded, reflective verses. The arc starts wide with the universal field and narrows toward daily practice, threading recurring motifs — a Rhodes stab in varied voicings, vocal‑cut scratch hooks, and tape‑warm textures. Two G‑funk‑colored cuts lift the mid‑album energy. Sequencing favors a confident opener, early singles, a story centerpiece, and an anthemic closer. The tone stays coherent: present, ethical, and communal without preachiness.</p></div>

[Rhodes stab over dusty loop; city ambience]

[Verse 1]
Street map folded in my pocket, lines already drawn,
Signal in the static, I’m awake before the dawn.
Skyscrapers breathe with me, the circuits in the rain,
I’m part of bigger currents, not a solo in the frame.
Comet trails of headlights, the boroughs in a grid,
If truth is in the pattern, I align with how it is.
Hands steady on the moment, mind clear of the debt,
I set the needle gently, hear the record place the bet.

[Chorus]
Mind set, in a field already moving,
Mind set, every breath is part of proving.
Mind set, when the noise says “break,” we’re smoothing,
Mind set — tune the heart, keep it grooving.

[Verse 2]
I learned from every detour, not a page I have to burn,
Compost what was heavy, let the soil take its turn.
Neighbors on the corner pass advice like vinyl sleeves,
We sample what is living, not the names that people need.
Thought, action, being — triangulate the tone,
When patterns carry forward, I don’t push it all alone.
Breath anchors the attention, like a kick behind a snare,
I ride with what is lawful — there’s a music in the air.

[Instrumental Break]
[DJ scratches “mind… set” over the loop; short solo]

[Chorus]
Mind set, in a field already moving,
Mind set, every breath is part of proving.
Mind set, when the noise says “break,” we’re smoothing,
Mind set — tune the heart, keep it grooving.

[Verse 3]
Big talk never built a bridge, presence laid the brick,
I move in right proportions, let the swing provide the lift.
The hook ain’t just a lyric, it’s a practice in the flesh,
I’m checking where I’m leaning, bring the cadence into breath.
From rooftop to the river, from the handset to the star,
We don’t own the conversation — we just answer where we are.
If power is alignment, then the chorus is the test,
Drop the ego’s heavy luggage, travel lighter, do what’s best.

[Chorus]
Mind set, in a field already moving,
Mind set, every breath is part of proving.
Mind set, when the noise says “break,” we’re smoothing,
Mind set — tune the heart, keep it grooving.

[Soft piano loop; wind over rooftop]

[Verse 1]
We chalked names on the mailbox, paint chipped, third floor,
Smoke rose from the vendor cart, rain pooled by the door.
He said the block remembers you, even when you dip,
Old heads pour a little out, stories on the lip.
I used to fear the endings, like a lock with missing keys,
But seasons taught a lesson in the rustle of the leaves —
What falls feeds what’s coming; it’s a long exchange of roles,
I tuck that truth like cash, folded quiet in my soul.

[Refrain]
Nothing vanishes — it transforms.
What falls feeds what’s coming on.

[Instrumental Break]
[4‑bar turnaround on the loop]

[Verse 2]
We lost the bodega owner, but the awning stayed the same,
His nephew learned the register, kept the ledger with his name.
The chairs out on the sidewalk took the shape of missing friends,
We pass along their phrases till the grammar never ends.
I shelved the self I carried that was heavy, out of date,
Let rain erase the chalk lines, there’s a cleaner way to wait.
What changes ain’t a vanishing, it’s fabric getting sewn —
You trace the thread by living, that’s the only way it’s known.

[Refrain]
Nothing vanishes — it transforms.
What falls feeds what’s coming on.

[Instrumental Break]
[4‑bar turnaround; add subtle scratches]

[Verse 3]
A cousin left for somewhere warm; he mails back winter coats,
We laugh at how we used to be, then turn it into notes.
I compost all my bravado, let the pride become the ground,
So something real can root in me and push a new sound.
You hear it in this record: dust and hiss that used to be
Some other song, some other scene, now breathing into me.
I’m learning how to honor what the world refuses to lose —
When nothing really vanishes, you rise by what you choose.

[Refrain]
Nothing vanishes — it transforms.
What falls feeds what’s coming on.

[Staccato Rhodes stab; rimshot count‑in]

[Verse 1]
I don’t muscle past the moment, I adjust and find the line,
When the metronome is honest, all the choices fall in time.
Every habit that was heavy gets recut into a groove,
I remove what keeps me static so the rest is free to move.
When attention is a lens, I keep it clear of greasy thumbprints,
Do the work before the work — that’s how the record earns its drum print.
I’m the instrument I tune, not a crown I have to chase,
Let the swing do what it does and keep my ego out the bass.

[Chorus]
In tune — let the rhythm carry you,
In tune — keep it simple, keep it true.
In tune — mind, action, being too,
In tune — every bar a clearer view.

[Verse 2]
I used to write like sirens, always fighting every bar,
Till I learned to hear the pattern that was driving every car.
Now I lift when lifting’s needed and I lean when leaning helps,
Not a statue in the traffic, I’m a dancer with myself.
Let the pocket be the teacher, let the silence set the scene,
When you trust what’s already working, force falls out of every scheme.
Take the lesson from the record: little hiss, a little grit —
Still the truth comes through the needle; you can feel the center hit.

[Chorus]
In tune — let the rhythm carry you,
In tune — keep it simple, keep it true.
In tune — mind, action, being too,
In tune — every bar a clearer view.

[Verse 3]
If I’m asking where to start, I start exactly where I stand,
Bring my breath back to its measure, keep my timing in my hand.
What I can’t control, I honor; what I can, I make precise,
Then I step like it’s a record — drop the needle, roll the dice.
When the chorus hits again, it isn’t hype, it’s day to day,
All the small alignments stacking; that’s the only honest way.
If the current’s moving steady, I don’t swim against the set,
I just angle for the ferry, let the river do the rest.

[Chorus]
In tune — let the rhythm carry you,
In tune — keep it simple, keep it true.
In tune — mind, action, being too,
In tune — every bar a clearer view.

[Low‑pass loop; deep breath in]

[Verse 1]
Crosswalks argue with the horns, sellers cut the price,
Sirens paint the brick with blue; I slow and take advice.
One thing that I see, one I hear, one in my hand,
Presence like a metronome that helps the night to land.
I’m not dodging every ping; I’m choosing what to hear,
Putting all my weight on now, so now can hold me near.
If the habit tries to drag me to a yesterday I miss,
I set the needle back to breath — the record sounds like this:

[Chorus]
Here and now — where the city finds its slow,
Here and now — let the deeper current show.
Here and now — give the noise somewhere to go,
Here and now — breathe steady, keep it low.

[Verse 2]
Newsstand headlines thump a drum that isn’t mine to play,
I thank them for the service, then I put the sticks away.
Hands come back to pockets, shoulders settle into ease,
The rhythm’s in the sidewalk cracks and branches of the trees.
I let elevator chatter pass like trains between the stops,
When you stop needing to reply, the stress just curls and drops.
Whatever pulls me out of place can teach me how to stay,
So I bow to what I notice and I start again today.

[Chorus]
Here and now — where the city finds its slow,
Here and now — let the deeper current show.
Here and now — give the noise somewhere to go,
Here and now — breathe steady, keep it low.

[Verse 3]
I’m not chasing sacred calm; I’m meeting what it is,
Some days the drum is gentle, some days all it does is fizz.
Either way, I’m coming honest; I let gravity decide,
Lean the bar against the moment till the syllables align.
If each chorus is a practice, then this life’s a looping song,
You can’t force the needle’s journey; you just let it move along.
So the breath and kick agree, and the snare and thought shake hands —
Now I’m here enough to hear enough to do the next small plan.

[Chorus]
Here and now — where the city finds its slow,
Here and now — let the deeper current show.
Here and now — give the noise somewhere to go,
Here and now — breathe steady, keep it low.

[Horn stab; snare crack]

[Verse 1]
Not every fight is righteous, not every silence weak,
Balance isn’t cowardice; it’s math in how we speak.
Carry what you’re built for, set the rest down on the curb,
Integrity is action, not a slogan or a word.
When a friend needs space, I make it; when a line gets crossed, I say it,
I don’t flex for decoration; keep my compass where I lay it.
Right weight is how you move when eyes are off the stage —
You do small honest things, and that’s a lifetime paid.

[Chorus]
Carry the right weight — step with the right rate,
Move like the truth moves, steady through the bright days.
Carry the right weight — you don’t need a wide gate,
Just enough for one step, done in the right way.

[Verse 2]
I’ve seen loud men crumble when the check arrives at last,
All that thunder in their talking, but their numbers bleed the past.
I’ve watched quiet women anchor whole communities by hand,
No announcements, just decisions that keep rhythm in the band.
If I’m tempted by the spectacle, I ground it in a task —
Call my mother, sweep my doorway, write the truth and take the mask.
When the easy road is crooked, I will walk the slower street —
If my shoes fit what I’m claiming, then my rhymes won’t have to cheat.

[Chorus]
Carry the right weight — step with the right rate,
Move like the truth moves, steady through the bright days.
Carry the right weight — you don’t need a wide gate,
Just enough for one step, done in the right way.

[Verse 3]
Some nights I want the credit; let me name it, let it pass,
Being honest with the craving is how craving doesn’t last.
I return to what is mine — keep my corner swept and clean,
Do not amplify the chaos; tune the drum behind the scene.
If I’m trusted with a lever, I will pull it with a care —
Right proportion is the ethic; any more would be a tear.
In the end, the chorus measures what you carried, not your fame —
Did you shoulder what was yours? If yes, the rest can change.

[Chorus]
Carry the right weight — step with the right rate,
Move like the truth moves, steady through the bright days.
Carry the right weight — you don’t need a wide gate,
Just enough for one step, done in the right way.

[Crowd ambience; handclaps on 2 and 4]

[Verse 1]
It ain’t one man’s crown — it’s a table with some seats,
Pass a plate, pass a story, pass a rhythm to the beat.
OGs nod at new kids, new kids listen, then they speak,
We protect the little rituals that keep the circle deep.
If you learned the secret handshake, it was eye contact and care,
Pick the mic up when you’re ready, leave your pride out on the stairs.
When we lose a voice, we echo it till someone finds their own,
Not a freeze in marble statues — this tradition lives and grows.

[Chorus]
The circle lives! (Lives!) The chorus gives! (Gives!)
We move as one, that’s how the culture lives.
The circle lives! (Lives!) The chorus gives! (Gives!)
Your voice, my voice — listen how the rhythm lifts.

[Verse 2]
Market blooms on Saturday, the band plays something loose,
Someone sets a crate for babies so they hear a different truth.
Every nod is like a downbeat, every smile a small refrain,
It’s not rules, it’s resonances that keep us all in lane.
I’ve seen leaders without titles, I’ve seen titles with no weight —
The former fix the feedback, the latter argue at the gate.
We’re repairing what we’re given with the tools that we can use,
That’s the kind of live tradition no bureaucracy can bruise.

[Chorus]
The circle lives! (Lives!) The chorus gives! (Gives!)
We move as one, that’s how the culture lives.
The circle lives! (Lives!) The chorus gives! (Gives!)
Your voice, my voice — listen how the rhythm lifts.

[Verse 3]
Every cypher on the corner is a tiny parliament,
Not the laws, but listening — that’s the real establishment.
Bring your best and take your losses; either way we clap it up,
’Cause belonging is a practice, not a trophy or a cup.
If we want the scene tomorrow, then we feed it now and here,
Open hands and open schedules — help each other volunteer.
When the record hits the ending, we don’t panic that it ends —
We flip it, find the sample, let the theme return again.

[Chorus]
The circle lives! (Lives!) The chorus gives! (Gives!)
We move as one, that’s how the culture lives.
The circle lives! (Lives!) The chorus gives! (Gives!)
Your voice, my voice — listen how the rhythm lifts.

[Modem‑like sweep; needle crackle returns]

[Verse 1]
Thumb scroll learns my rhythm if I give it all my hours,
So I ration what I feed it; I retain my choosing powers.
Turn the phone into a tool, not a tractor for my mind,
Close the tabs like closing loops; leave the noise and keep the finds.
If the algorithm begs me with a sugar‑rush of light,
I exhale, set a timer, write a verse, and set it right.
Presence is a practice like a chorus you repeat —
Every time I want to wander, I return to hands and feet.

[Chorus]
Stay present online — let the mind be the design,
Not a puppet to the timeline or a puppet to the sign.
Stay present online — let your breath set the align,
Put the signal over static; make your scrolling into time.

[Verse 2]
I log out when I’m working so my focus has a room,
If the chat becomes a furnace, I don’t feed it any fumes.
Every message isn’t urgent; every ping is not a drum,
Some are wind against a window; some deserve a metronome.
Build a daily little scaffold: when to open, when to close,
Make a ritual of posting so your energy can grow.
I’m not hostile to the network; I just play it like a bass —
Right hand dampens what is fake; left hand walks a grounded pace.

[Chorus]
Stay present online — let the mind be the design,
Not a puppet to the timeline or a puppet to the sign.
Stay present online — let your breath set the align,
Put the signal over static; make your scrolling into time.

[Bridge]
Design is care in motion — choose proportions for your day,
Let the tools support attention, not the other kind of way.
Set the thresholds, mark transitions; keep your circles living well,
Then the chorus is a promise you can actually tell.

[Chorus]
Stay present online — let the mind be the design,
Not a puppet to the timeline or a puppet to the sign.
Stay present online — let your breath set the align,
Put the signal over static; make your scrolling into time.

[Chorus]
Stay present online — let the mind be the design,
Not a puppet to the timeline or a puppet to the sign.
Stay present online — let your breath set the align,
Put the signal over static; make your scrolling into time.

[Modem‑like sweep; needle crackle returns]

[Verse 1]
Thumb scroll learns my rhythm if I give it all my hours,
So I ration what I feed it; I retain my choosing powers.
Turn the phone into a tool, not a tractor for my mind,
Close the tabs like closing loops; leave the noise and keep the finds.
If the algorithm begs me with a sugar‑rush of light,
I exhale, set a timer, write a verse, and set it right.
Presence is a practice like a chorus you repeat —
Every time I want to wander, I return to hands and feet.

[Chorus]
Stay present online — let the mind be the design,
Not a puppet to the timeline or a puppet to the sign.
Stay present online — let your breath set the align,
Put the signal over static; make your scrolling into time.

[Verse 2]
I log out when I’m working so my focus has a room,
If the chat becomes a furnace, I don’t feed it any fumes.
Every message isn’t urgent; every ping is not a drum,
Some are wind against a window; some deserve a metronome.
Build a daily little scaffold: when to open, when to close,
Make a ritual of posting so your energy can grow.
I’m not hostile to the network; I just play it like a bass —
Right hand dampens what is fake; left hand walks a grounded pace.

[Chorus]
Stay present online — let the mind be the design,
Not a puppet to the timeline or a puppet to the sign.
Stay present online — let your breath set the align,
Put the signal over static; make your scrolling into time.

[Bridge]
Design is care in motion — choose proportions for your day,
Let the tools support attention, not the other kind of way.
Set the thresholds, mark transitions; keep your circles living well,
Then the chorus is a promise you can actually tell.

[Chorus]
Stay present online — let the mind be the design,
Not a puppet to the timeline or a puppet to the sign.
Stay present online — let your breath set the align,
Put the signal over static; make your scrolling into time.

[Chorus]
Stay present online — let the mind be the design,
Not a puppet to the timeline or a puppet to the sign.
Stay present online — let your breath set the align,
Put the signal over static; make your scrolling into time.

[Airy pad; faint vinyl hush]

[Verse 1]
I can point but I can’t package what the edges try to show —
Like a lamplight on a river, truth is moving as it glows.
Every time I try to trap it in a tidy little phrase,
It dissolves like fog at sunrise, leaves a warmth and leaves a haze.
So I rhyme around the outline, let the silence write a bar,
Give the chorus room to hover like a message from afar.
If I’m faithful to the feeling more than owning what it means,
Then the mystery stays luminous, not flattened by my schemes.

[Chorus]
Leave room — let the mystery speak,
Leave room — let the silence teach.
Leave room — we’re the choir and the reach,
Leave room — for the luminous beneath.

[Verse 2]
Some truths wear a hooded garment, keep their faces out of sight,
If you drag them into daylight, they stop singing, stop their light.
Better walk with them in whispers, keep your steps a softer time,
Let the beat suggest the meaning like a shadow under rhyme.
I’ve been wrong when I was certain, I’ve been right when I was small —
When I’m humble, I can hear it; when I’m loud, I miss the call.
So the chorus isn’t answer; it’s the clearing on the trail —
We stand still and let the forest tell the next part of the tale.

[Chorus]
Leave room — let the mystery speak,
Leave room — let the silence teach.
Leave room — we’re the choir and the reach,
Leave room — for the luminous beneath.

[Verse 3]
In the pauses of a city, in the breath between replies,
In the way a record crackle makes the present sound alive —
There’s a knowing without wording, there’s a seeing without eyes,
Not a riddle to be conquered, but a weather in the skies.
So I end without an ending, like a circle never done,
Let the needle lift with reverence for what’s bigger than my tongue.
If you feel it, you don’t name it; if you name it, let it go —
We can stand here in the shimmer, that’s enough for what we know.

[Chorus]
Leave room — let the mystery speak,
Leave room — let the silence teach.
Leave room — we’re the choir and the reach,
Leave room — for the luminous beneath.

[Rhodes stab; handclap pickup]

[Verse 1]
People want the mountain; I just lace another shoe,
Stack the reps in quiet rooms till something sturdy follows through.
Every “later” is a liar; now’s the only honest clock,
So I put a line of bricks where I can reach and let it lock.
I don’t chase a magic method; I return to breath and pen,
Count my blessings like a tempo — one, and two, and start again.
When the thunder fades to weather, you can hear the steady rain —
That’s the rhythm change your life with, not the fireworks in pain.

[Chorus]
Small moves — every day, same groove,
Small moves — let the work make proof.
Small moves — keep it plain, keep true,
Small moves — watch the ground turn new.

[Verse 2]
I’ve been loud and I’ve been noble; only one of those will build,
Nobility is repetition; loud is sugar when you’re ill.
So I take my medicine in actions I can stand,
If it fits into a minute, it can spread across the land.
Check the boxes that you made, not the ones that make you numb,
Put the finish line in inches so your courage learns to come.
Every chorus is a contract, not a slogan for a crowd —
If I sing it, I must do it when the music isn’t loud.

[Chorus]
Small moves — every day, same groove,
Small moves — let the work make proof.
Small moves — keep it plain, keep true,
Small moves — watch the ground turn new.

[Verse 3]
When I miss, I make it tiny — pick a single next right step,
No performative repentance; just respect for what is kept.
If I brag, I brag in doing: swept the floor, returned the call,
Wrote the verse, paid the favor — little debts that free us all.
Some will laugh at what looks trivial; I don’t owe them any show,
We are building future cities out of minutes that we own.
When the chorus comes, it doubles like a promise made to two —
Me and me‑tomorrow shaking hands on what we’ll do.

[Chorus]
Small moves — every day, same groove,
Small moves — let the work make proof.
Small moves — keep it plain, keep true,
Small moves — watch the ground turn new.

[Chorus]
Small moves — every day, same groove,
Small moves — let the work make proof.
Small moves — keep it plain, keep true,
Small moves — watch the ground turn new.
